***Vehicle Management System***



***Features***


Vehicle Type Selection: Allows users to select a vehicle type (Car, Truck, or Motorcycle).
Vehicle Detail Entry: Users can input details like license number, make, model, and year for the selected vehicle.
Data Storage: Saves entered vehicle data into a JSON file for future reference.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter, providing an easy-to-use GUI for interaction.
Error Handling: Displays error messages if required fields are not filled in or if there is an issue saving the data.


***Technology Used***


Python 3: Programming language used for the development of this application.
Tkinter: A Python library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
JSON: Used for saving and storing vehicle data in a structured format.
ABC (Abstract Base Class): Used to define abstract methods in the Vehicle class, ensuring derived classes implement the required functionality.


***Installation***



Clone or download the repository.
Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from here.
Install the Tkinter module (it comes pre-installed with Python). If it's not already installed, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install tk
Run the script using:
bash
Copy code
python vehicle_management_system.py


***Usage***


Launch the application by running the Python script.
Choose a vehicle type (Car, Truck, or Motorcycle) from the main menu.
Enter the required details (license number, make, model, and year) in the provided fields.
Press the "Save" button to store the entered vehicle details in a vehicle_data.json file.
You can exit the application by clicking the "Exit" button.
